# Finance Record

## Purpose

- To raise an awareness of my spendings and earnings
- To practice use of data visualization by displaying graphs
- To practice use of GUI so that the user can easily access the program.

## Functionality

1. Simple calculations of expenses and revenues. Users are required to put in the numbers everyday (or for each spending).
2. The record will take other informations (date, category, where spent, etc)
3. The financial statement will be recorded on a csv. (Just in case of an error, find a way to make a copy)
